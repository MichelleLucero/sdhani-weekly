## About Me :blush:
I'm currently a junior at Hunter College and a part of the computer science scholar program there known as *Daedalus*. Being a CS scholar alone has given me a lot of opportunities to participate and engage in the tech world by both attending various tech panels and through insightful mentorships with engineers in the field. Last summer, I had the honor of partaking in the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline Residency where I completed a FullStack BootCamp and interned at a startup called Shared_Studios. While at the company, I contributed to a JavaScript based internal management system that went into Beta-use following the end of that summer. Due to the lack of restriction on the project, I had the opportunity to work on various aspects of the application, including refactoring existing code. I gratefully walked away from this experience with newfound knowledge on the SCRUM working environment, extensive knowledge on new technologies, and a better appreciation for teamwork, communication and time-management in the tech field. Since this experience, I've dedicated most of my time to technical interview preparation. Over this past Winter break I attended a technical interview bootcamp to familiarize myself on the process and better prepare myself for the experience. Now I, on the request of one of my professors, have recently started a position as an undergraduate teaching assisstant in the Computer Science department. I look forward to growing from this experience as well as acquire skills that I can use to give back to my tech community. 

### More Information
When I'm not doing coding related things, I enjoy reading, paper-crafting, spending time with my family, and binge-watching mystery tv-shows.
