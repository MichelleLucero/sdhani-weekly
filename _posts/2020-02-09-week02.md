*Ways I'd like to Contribute & Potential Benefits*

Defining goals can be a tricky thing. One often has to wonder about balance, timeline, and perhaps even go as far as to define a global motivation variable that can be read often to renew one’s vigor and interest in that goal. So when I establish the ways in which I inspire to contribute to open source projects this semester, it is with these factors in mind. 
1) Contributing to a project’s *documentation* (whether it be improving it, appending it, and/or converting it to a more useful format) is one way that I’d like to contribute to open source projects this semester. Since I already enjoy note-taking and stylizing, this goal seems to be up my alley, however it will be interesting to see what kinds of problems I may encounter in this arena.
    * On an extension to this, it may be interesting to see if I could contribute icons or backgrounds to a project, if needed. I do like to sketch a lot in my free time so this goal could be fun. But style is subjective, and it will be interesting to see what contribution guidelines projects have.
3) I would love to expand the resources of an educational FOSS project by contributing amendments to the project’s*content* and perhaps even offering a few additions to the current content. 
4) <b>A *reach for the stars* kind of goal</b>I’ve read a ton of bug reports when debugging code and learning new technologies, however, I’ve never actually submitted any bug reports. It will take a lot of time and familiarity with a project in order to identify a bug in the program and then formulate that bug in terms that resonate with the community. 
5) <b>One for the bucket-list </b> It would be super cool to contribute an *actual* line of code to a FOSS project. I imagine that it’s a goal that takes a lot of time and familiarity with a project to accomplish, but would also be really gratifying.
