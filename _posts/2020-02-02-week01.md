I decided to take Open Source Software Development this semester because I was hoping that the course would teach me how to give back to the world. I'm specifically interested in improving people's access to educational resources. Growing up in a community where a lot of my peers fell out of the school system because they lacked the resources necessary to thrive gave me an early perspective on the importance of an educational system *for all*. When I got selected for a top high school, I quickly became aware of the difference that having access to educational tools gave me. One day I would like to contribute to free and open source educational software/resources so that people who can not afford to purchase competitive products can use them openly to expand their knowledge. I firmly believe that everyone has a right to access education and learn something new.
