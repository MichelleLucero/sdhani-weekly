## *Skills Useful to FOSS Projects*
#### Powerups I've acquired since `int life = 0` :

A few skills that I've developed outside of the classroom :  
- *<b>Creativity</b>* : Although I won't be claiming an *art major* anytime soon :smile:, I'd like to think that I am a creative person. I like to build things from scratch (both in the physical and virtual realm) and enjoy being expressive through art. This can be a useful skill in improving a project's interface and design and for adding a new perspective to the coding challenges a project may have. Afterall, creativity doesn't stop at art, and can lead to potentially innovative solutions.    
- *<b>Programming Skills</b>* : Through my previous internship experiences, I've had the opportunity to use a variety of Fullstack Web Development tools and technologies related to the MERN and NERD teck stacks. This background may make it easier for me to contribute to Web based projects in a meaningful and impactful way. For example, I can help test features in the project and check for bugs. I can also (potentially) contribute code or refactor existing code in a way that improves the project's overall extensibility and matainability.  

Classroom skills are still pretty *Nifty* :  
- *<b>Outgoing and active in collaborative discussions</b>* : If needed, I can be very outgoing and active in collaborative discussions. While I may assert my own viewpoint, I care about everyone's opinion and feedback. Afterall, diverse discussions lead to the best product results and active collaborations will point out flaws or shortcomings that were not intially accounted for.  
- *<b>Notes for the future</b>* : Over the years of rigorous coursework, I've developed the ability to not only take good notes, but to organize them in a clear and concise way. This skill can be used to contribute to a project's documentation page.  
- *<b>Nothing like a good jigsaw puzzle</b>* : I've always enjoyed solving *actual* jigsaw puzzles. In fact, part of my passion for programming and mathematics comes from my interest in puzzle-solving in general. So when it comes to troubleshooting bugs and putting pieces together, this is a skill that will come in handy for tackling my bigger contribution goals for this course *(see week 2 post)*.

### Free-Time Fillers  

For the most part, I like participating in any kind of creative activity on my free-time, including, but not limited to the following:
  * Drawing/Painting/Coloring
  * Paper-Crafting  (Origami and [Quilling](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quilling#English))
  * Baking 
  
Other miscellaneous passions include:
  * Programming
  * Tutoring/Teaching
  * Reading novels, comics, poems, plays, and short stories
  * Binge-watching Sci-fi TV shows
   
###### Free-time fillers are limitless because the thing I enjoy doing the most is
##### *<b>Learning how to do new things</b>*

### Contributions Made This Week

This week I made a few contributions to OpenStreet Map. I updated four different store listings, modified one building status, added two retail spaces to the map and removed three stores that no longer exist from the map. Links to these specific contributions can be found in the *Contributions* tab above.
