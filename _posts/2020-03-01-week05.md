## *Judging a Project by its GitHub Repo (...more or less)*

<!-- Comment on the project evaluation that you did in class. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions. -->
<!-- From the current set of projects listed in the wiki, including those added by your classmates, which is your first choice to work on? -->

As it turns out, choosing an open source project to contribute to is tough work. There are many things to consider about a project, such as its *License* , it's *Activity Level*, its *Codebase and Code Documentation*, and its *Community Welcomeness* when deciphering if it's a good fit for you. For the projects that I evaluated this week ( [Zulip](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/zulip_evaluation_2.md) and [Godot](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/godot_evaluation.md) ) I found that the hardest aspects to evaluate for both projects was the *community's welcomeness* section and the *community's activity level* section. The big takeaway from this excercise was ***Don't Judge a Project solely by its GitHub Page***. 



### Learning The Tricks of the Trade:
**It's a Scavenger Hunt**: 
- While a project's GitHub repo can reveal a lot about the project at a glance--it doesn't reveal everything. For example, the most revealing evidence about the Zulip's *community welcomeness* to new-comers came from the project's developer chat channel--not from discussions happening on GitHub. Since most of the communications within the project's pull requests and issues on GitHub were actually between community members and the ZulipBot system, it was hard to gauge how welcoming the core maintainers of the project actually were to new-comers. A few more minutes of hunting through a dozen more of recently closed issues and pull requests would be more telling of the project's community ettiquette, but so was simply checking the project's chat channel. (Although, I did do the former first, my confidence was solidifed by the latter). After a few seconds of roaming on the project's developer chat channel I instantly found support channels for new-comers, lengthy conversations between new-comers and established community members, and current bugs, updates, and features in the works. It was a great way to get a sense of what it would actually be like to be a part of the community.
- On the other hand, for the Godot project evaluation that I completed earlier this week, hunting through the commentary embedded within closed pull requests and issues alone were telling of the community's treatment towards new-comers since there was no automated response system used (so GitHub's still a good place to start :smile:). 

**Filtering Out the Past**: Learning how to customize my filter when searching through the project's pull requests and issues greatly simplified most aspects in determining a project's activity level. This is an important aspect of a project because if there hasn't been any kind of activity in the project for the past few months, then there are probably no active maintainers or opened issues that are easily fixed in the project. Therefore, I would likely struggle to contribute to it. ON the other hand, if there is too much activity, with issues being claimed and solved within the day, then perhaps this project is too active to be able to contribute to it. Since determining the project's *activity level* required accuracy and careful tedious evaluation, I found determining this information to be difficult.
