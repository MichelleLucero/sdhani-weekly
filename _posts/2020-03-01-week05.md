## *Judging a Project by its GitHub Repo (...more or less)*

<!-- Comment on the project evaluation that you did in class. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions. -->
<!-- From the current set of projects listed in the wiki, including those added by your classmates, which is your first choice to work on? -->

As it turns out, choosing an open source project to contribute to is tough work. Not only must you evaluate your own skills and interests but ***you must also evaluate the project itself***. There are many important aspects of a project to consider before making the final decision. For the projects that I evaluated this week [Zulip](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/zulip_evaluation_2.md) and [Godot](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/godot_evaluation.md) I found that the hardest aspect to evaluate for both projects was the *community's welcomeness* and the *community's activity level*. The big takeaway from this excercise is ***Don't Judge a Project solely by its GitHub Page***. 

#### Learning Where + How to Look:
**It's a Scavenger Hunt**: While a project's GitHub landing page can reveal a lot about the project at a glance--it doesn't reveal everything. For example, the most telling characteristics on a *community's welcomeness to new-comers* may actually be found in the project's third-party developer chat channels instead of on GitHub itself. Such was the case in evaluating [Zulip's]() *community welcomeness*. Since most of the communications within the project's pull requests and issues were between community members and the ZulipBot system, it was hard to tell how welcoming core maintainers in the project actually were. A few more minutes and a few dozen more opened tabs on recently closed issues and pull requests would shed more light on the project's community ettiquette, but is not necessary. After a few seconds of roaming on the project's developer chat channel I instantly found support channels for new-comers, lengthy conversations between new-comers and established community members, and current bugs, updates, and features in the works. It was a great way to get a sense of what it would actually be like to be a part of the community. For the Godot project that I evaluated earlier this week, sifting through commentary embedded with closed pull requests and issues were also telling, (so GitHub's still useful :smile: ). 

**Sifting Through Closed Issues and Pull Requests**: Learning how to filter through the project's pull requests and issues greatly simplified the evaluation of a project's activity level.
