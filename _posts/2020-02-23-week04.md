## *Looking for a Unicorn FOSS Project* :unicorn:

##### Those that Got the Axe ( Eliminated + Why ):
-  [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium) : Stellarium is an open source 3D software application that renders a *realistic sky*. It brings a real-time planetarium straight to your computer. :star:
    - <b>*Reservations*</b> :  The project at a glance seems to be super cool. However, while it has a LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING file, and a README, the lack of a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file is evident in the maintainers' response etiquette. After examining both the project's closed pull requests and closed issues, the maintainers' responses seemed curt, short, and perhaps a bit discriminatory and insensitive. Now, this may be an example of a straight-forward community that likes to get to the point, but it ultimately turned me off from the project.  

##### Promising Candidates:
- <b> *Emoji-Filled Commit Messages* </b> :smile: :fire: :wave:
  - [Postwoman](github.com/liyasthomas/postwoman): Having had the opportunity to work with *Postman*, this project instantly caught my eye (in a humorous and unexpected way). It's advertised as a lightweight and faster version of Postman for developers with "low-end" computers. Like Postman, it is an API request builder with a few more customization features. The community seems to super bright and cheery, and overall I get good vibes from the contributors. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE and README files are easy to understand and straight-forward. I'm all for providing access to educational/workflow applications that normal people can't afford to use due to limitations in resources and hardware. So it's no surprise that I find this project exciting. Plus, I've never seen a repository with so many emoji-filled commit messages! Honestly, it's fun to just read the messages alone.


- <b>*Feel Good Mission*</b> :relaxed:
  - [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) : There's a lot to like about this project. It's purpose is learning motivated, it has a friendly and welcoming community that is moderately active (with issues and merges occuring within the past few hours of this post). Plus, I can instantly see a bunch of ways that I can contribute to it right now. It touches upon my interest in contributing to an educational open source project, and I can easily apply my tutoring skills here to get started.


##### Contributions This Week

This week I made several contributions to OpenStreetMap. The specifics of these contributions can be found in the *Contributions* tab above.
